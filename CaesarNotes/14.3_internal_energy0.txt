The individual kinetic. 
Add the electrostatic potential energy. 
It's kinetic energy maybe 0 wise. 
Absolute zero the coldest possible temperature then not moving. 
That's what you mean by 0. 
Potential energy at absolute 0 absolute. 
That's 0 but that is not absolute 0. 
Potential that's 0 the internal energy is a minute. 
It's not zero because of the potential energy it's a minimum and if you read that section. 
You'd read all about that so we can increase. 
Internal energy two ways you can increase the kinetic energy. 
Add add. 
I'm going to look at today. 
Go to change state for us up to now. 
We haven't really considered the change of state of anything we just make things hot. 
Change the state. 
Then she's coming. 
Since change state. 
It's just set the scene for what i'm going to show you. 
Remember this you didn't do it gcse. 
What year was 4 years ago. 
Where is 2018. 
Hello is a shortened name of something. 
Convenient temperature is candle wax and we have done in the past. 
Add. 
What we've got we will have. 
Is a test tube with some liquid salon. 
I'm going to put a temperature probe. 
Temperature in the salon. 
Temperature probe hit the salon and. 
Be connected to a data logger and we are going to observe. 
The temperature of the sample changes with time. 
Is your program working. 
I'm going to do. 
Is. 
Tell the streets picked up my data logger. 
Wheel of death. 
And remove. 
Set timer for 10 minutes. 
And what we will do is just to allow it. 
To run through. 
I would just seen how the temperature for the salon. 
Go back to this question. 
Explain why it's not possible. 
Turn on absolute. 
That's what i was saying when we actually ever got to the lowest possible temperature. 
K the best fridge in the universe always used to be at lancaster university. 
You were really good but juggling. 
Is a latent talent that you had latent. 
Heating something up and melt it and it is melting. 
You still supplying heat but you not increasing the temperature so what would our explanation for that. 
Is it breaking the law. 
What bus would we mean by kinetic. 
What's that in measure of a measure of what. 
Temperature we will come back to this. 
Changing state of its melting from solid to liquid is temperature is not. 
Can't stay the same so this is not going into kinetic energy. 
Is melting is going from a solid close. 
A liquid weather further apart so the reason that there's no change in temperature. 
My thermal energy is changing state. 
Kinetic energy. 
Goes into potential. 
How can i make you bigger. 
Def leppard 10 send you with more than the ice ignore the same tempo. 
Yes how does gas. 
Material. 
That temperature not with your 1 degrees. 
That temperature get the pressure right get the volume right you can. 
Transfers. 
Is all the mass of balancing the pressure volume and temperature. 
How's the three v properties of a gas. 
When you will it hits the cold surface. 
It condenses. 
Coolest dan why do we sweat. 
The water into vapour and it's drawing in and out of. 
Changing state. 
The other graph going on. 
It's not going to white solid. 
Ok i think i'm going to give you a few notes. 
Turn lights and peace and then we'll. 
Switch the numbers to this. 
Ultimately it's. 
Occasion to go for a liquid for gas. 
But there's no change in temperature state change. 
Temperature. 
Change of state. 
It's cooling down then. 
What temperature. 
Liquid to gas liquid solid. 
No change in temperature. 
Solidifying. 
The salon. 
So losing potential energy. 
Wait change state the particles are going close together. 
What advantages does a data logger have over me just getting a thermometer. 
Reduce human error yes continuous. 
Lots and lots of readings and i can take it for as long as. 
Advantages to using data. 
Tell us the particles are. 
Getting closer. 
Generally. 
Heating curve at commune curve. 
What it is most substances as they get hotter. 
Heating curve this. 
Solid liquid. 
Heating curve. 
Volume point. 
Vacation or melting. 
Vacation or melting free. 
Change of state can you freeze nitrogen. 
Temperature is boiling - 100. 
Boiling point it's solidification. 
My name. 
Have a refrigerator. 
Your fridge the liquid go round the fridge if the fridge is hot of the north degrees. 
To get the gas back into a liquid you need to lose heat. 
Radiator. 
Gas back into a liquid that runs through it again so. 
We can work out how much heat we need to change a kilogram device. 
Specific heat capacity. 
2 kg to boil a kg of water how much. 
Add a subtitle specific. 
Specific latent heat capacity. 
Is going to simple capital l. 
Specific heat capacity. 
Needed to change 1kg of material completely. 
Solid to liquid or liquid to gas because of that they'll be to differ. 
Change a solid to a liquid compared to a liquid to a gas which one is it. 
Per kg of matter make a fair. 
Yes. 
Solids in the book. 
You've got to move the particles apart but they're not usually further apart. 
The separation of interested in. 
To get liquid particles and liquid particles. 
The two types of numbers. 
Lsl subscription. 
Of fusion estate change that ways. 
Liquid to. 
It doesn't matter which way because. 
So that's that's what i was going to a liquid. 
Specific latent heat of vaporization. 
Pacific latent heat of vaporization. 
And that's when a liquid go to a gas or vice versa. 
Lf. 
Even vaporization for. 
Fusion x the max. 
Energy per unit mass. 
That's joules per kilogramme kg. 
Energy per unit mass. 
How to change. 
The question is how much energy is. 
Naughty greasy on the change. 
So here we're gonna use. 
The equals ml and. 
The equals l and b e. 
As it changes state. 
Mc delta theta. 
Steam. 
The definition of the specific latent heat energy. 
It needs to lose 330 kg. 
= mc delta theta. 
I did it yesterday and it wasn't good. 
Right now demo do you need a comfort break. 
Play alarm for school. 
I'm afraid. 
5%. 
Paper. 
Homework. 
You got no internet.
