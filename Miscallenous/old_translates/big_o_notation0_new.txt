It's a very very simple if you look at it it's basically saying you've got a thousand you've got one yeah and he / 2 that's your average value and many x 1000.

That's the average value of the thousand things this is the number of the number of data points so that the the sun or you can go through iterate through 1000 items and add each one to the to the sun to get some which is the more efficient way to do it. 
Doing things the way that you would do as a computer scientist or as a programmer it's really helpful to have a mathematical head on you to be thinking what does a match mate so that's one step that's 1000 steps that's going to take the normal roughly 1000 of the time of that one yeah.

That's wrong because i summon you get rid of that statement that's where they want you to end up so a function is defined by an equation. 
And if you're going to put that into a into into code will be producing something like this so why cos 3x + 2 can be written also as funk is a function of n which equals 3 and + 2 and where they're going to go with they're going to go into whether something to check whether it's.

Go to that example you're basically adding the counter every time if you have twice as many items to come through so if any is 1500 it's going to take twice as long if it is if it is 2500.

No variables in it at all then it's only ever going to have one value it's not it doesn't matter it's always so that's where it was confusing me going it was going towards the idea of a linear function.

Turn the upper thames order of magnitude of a quadratic function is written as big o and square the dominant term is the one used when comparing algorithms so we ignore the bmmc terms so the thing which is determining the order of magnitude of the result. 
And squared if you go back to that one which was confusing earlier this one that's what i think they were getting out there but should have been inside code i think they. 
They just copy the slide because of that one ok here should have had in there i think they meant to have that and that's comparable but it wasn't.

There were two different functions one was a quadratic the other one was ok. 
Then it's actually very easy to determine where what the order of the function is whether it's static linear or quadratic i would this when it's embedded in code and you've got to understand what the code is doing.

What this means if you're taking very very large numbers you take logs of them you certainly start getting quite manageable numbers out and you can plot there's graph so log log graph semi-log plots i used a lot in physics i guess they might be used for large datasets and economics and business as well.

Those things that you can press the middle of the same as this but with bass to but the key thing is that the function increases very slowly in relation to end in maths do you do natural logarithms as well. 
What you find it university of what i found computing university is at university day if you haven't got the number 10 in there and someone writes log there is humanism.

Is a measure of the time complexity of an algorithm approximations of george that goes back to what you were just saying it's just an approximation of the time taken to execute an algorithm for a given number of items in the dataset and algorithm of time complexity 0 to the end increases in a linear way so 10000 items.

Constance so you are saying if something is going to take twice as long but if you were if it's an as opposed to n squared then you're putting in 10 values than 10 values is going to be 10 or 20 but if it's 10 squared it's going to be going up.
