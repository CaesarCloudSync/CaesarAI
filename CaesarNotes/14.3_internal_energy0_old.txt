That's for next turn. 
The individual kinetic. 
Add the electrostatic potential energy. 
Has a important ratio to absolute zero. 
If something is absolute 0 then. 
It's kinetic energy maybe 0 wise. 
Absolute zero the coldest possible temperature. 
Absolute zero the coldest possible temperature then not moving. 
Does that mean they're internal energy is 0. 
Does that mean they're internal energy is zero why not because. 
The still force. 
Energy is just a very small amount compared to what is normally. 
That's what you mean by 0. 
Attraction there is still. 
Potential energy at absolute 0. 
Potential energy at absolute 0 absolute. 
That's 0 but that is not absolute 0. 
Potential that's 0 the internal energy is a minute. 
It's not zero because of the potential energy it's a minimum and if you read that section. 
Read all about that. 
You'd read all about that so we can increase. 
Internal energy 2 ways. 
Internal energy two ways you can increase the kinetic energy. 
What happens to increase the potential energy. 
Add add. 
I'm going to look at today. 
Volume using a typical cell. 
Go to change state for us up to now. 
We haven't really considered the change of state of anything we just make things hot. 
Change the state. 
Then she's coming. 
Since change state. 
I'm gonna go through the questions afterwards. 
It's just set the scene for what i'm going to show you. 
Can you. 
Remember this you didn't do it gcse. 
What year was 4 years ago. 
3 years ago 2019. 
Where is 2018. 
Play some heat. 
Hello is a shortened name of something. 
It's just a material convenient it melts. 
Convenient temperature is candle wax and we have done in the past. 
Add. 
What we've got we will have. 
Is a test tube with some liquid salon. 
I'm gonna put a temperature. 
I'm going to put a temperature probe. 
Into. 
Temperature in the salon. 
Temperature probe hit the salon and. 
Be connected to a data logger and we are going to observe. 
The temperature of the salon change. 
The temperature of the sample changes with time. 
I will get it going. 
Is your program working. 
I'm going to do. 
Is. 
Tell the streets picked up my data. 
Tell the streets picked up my data logger. 
Wheel of death. 
And remove. 
Set timer for 10 minutes. 
And what we will do is just to allow it. 
To run through. 
I would just seen how we the temperature. 
I would just seen how the temperature for the salon. 
We'll see how that that cools. 
Go back to this question. 
Explain why it's not possible. 
Turn on absolute. 
That's what i was saying when we actually ever got to the lowest possible temperature. 
Oh yes this is radiate. 
K the best fridge in the universe always used to be at lancaster university. 
You were really good but juggling. 
Is a latent talent that you had latent. 
Heating something up and melt it and it is melting. 
You still supplying heat but you not increasing the temperature so what would our explanation for that. 
Is it breaking the law. 
What bus would we mean by kinetic. 
What's that in measure of a measure of. 
Temperature we will come back to this. 
If something has got a high temperature. 
Pub the moon faster. 
Changing state of its melting from solid to liquid is temperature is not. 
Can't stay the same so this is not going into kinetic energy. 
When was to be going potential. 
Is melting is going from a solid close. 
A liquid weather further apart so the reason that there's no change in temperature. 
My thermal energy is changing state. 
Kinetic energy. 
Goes into potential. 
How can i make you bigger. 
Has more energy than a kilogramme of ice. 
Def leppard 10 send you with more than the ice ignore the same tempo. 
Yes how does gas. 
Material. 
That temperature not with your 1 degrees. 
That temperature get the pressure right get the volume right you can. 
Transfers. 
Is all the mass of balancing the pressure volume and temperature. 
How's the three v properties of a gas. 
When you will it hits the cold surface. 
It condenses. 
He can't see but they can dance like before bigger water drop. 
Why do we sweat. 
Coolest dan why do we sweat. 
Blender water droplets evaporating and they will need any. 
The water into vapour and it's drawing. 
The water into vapour and it's drawing in and out of. 
Changing state. 
The other graph going on. 
It's not going to white solid. 
Ok i think i'm going to give you a few notes. 
Turn lights and peace and then we'll. 
Switch the numbers to this. 
This graph. 
So he starts off the liquid salon it's just getting cooler. 
Ultimately. 
Ultimately it's. 
Occasion to go for a liquid for gas. 
But there's no change in temperature. 
But there's no change in temperature state change. 
Temperature. 
Change of state. 
It's cooling down then. 
What temperature. 
Liquid to gas liquid solid. 
No change in temperature. 
Solidifying. 
The salon. 
So losing potential energy. 
Energy. 
Wait change state the particles are going close together. 
Reduce human error yes. 
Reduce human error yes continuous. 
It's less boring. 
Lots and lots of readings and i can take it for as long as. 
Advantages to using data. 
Tell us the particles are. 
Getting closer. 
Generally. 
Heating curve at commune curve. 
What it is most substances as they get hot. 
What it is most substances as they get hotter. 
Heating curve this. 
Solid liquid. 
Heating curve. 
Volume point. 
Vacation or melting. 
Vacation or melting free. 
Change of state can you freeze. 
Change of state can you freeze nitrogen. 
Temperature is boiling - 100. 
Boiling point it's solidification. 
Manners and harrison. 
My name. 
Volume to 10. 
Have a refrigerator. 
Your fridge the liquid go round the fridge if the fridge is hot of the north degrees. 
To get the gas back into a liquid you need to lose. 
The last service area you want to lose heating. 
The last service area you wanted to lucy paint it black. 
Radiator. 
Gas back into a liquid that runs through it again so. 
Okie dokie so went to do now. 
Is just to talk through. 
We can work out how much heat we need to. 
We can work out how much heat we need to change a kilogram device. 
Kilogramme of water. 
So we just need to choose another quantity. 
Similar calculations how much. 
2 kg to boil a kg of water how much. 
Add a subtitle specific. 
Analogous to. 
Specific latent heat capacity. 
Is going to simple capital l. 
Specifically. 
Specific heat capacity. 
Specific heat capacity. 
Like this. 
Needed to change 1kg of material completely. 
Because they are two-faced changes. 
Solid to liquid or liquid to gas because. 
Solid to liquid or liquid to gas because of that they'll be to differ. 
Takes more or less energy. 
Change a solid to a liquid compared to a liquid to a gas which one is it. 
Per kg of matter make a fair. 
Change in. 
Yes. 
Gas ism underestimate how much energy they possess. 
Solids in the book. 
You've got to move the particles apart. 
You've got to move the particles apart but they're not. 
You've got to move the particles apart but they're not usually further apart. 
They have a translational motion to them in liquid. 
A liquid to a gas you've got to get them a much further apart. 
You are really break their bonds and fleeces. 
Is all about potential energy. 
The separation of interested in. 
To get liquid particles and liquid particles. 
Gaseous form comparison. 
A liquid to a gas is a bigger number than a solid to a. 
The two types of numbers. 
Lsl subscription. 
Of fusion estate change that ways. 
Liquid to. 
It doesn't matter which way. 
It doesn't matter which way because. 
So that's that's what i was going to a liquid. 
Specific latent heat of vaporization. 
Pacific latent heat of vaporization. 
And that's when a liquid go to a gas or vice versa. 
Two different types of specific latent heat. 
Lf. 
Even vaporization for. 
Fusion x the max. 
Energy per unit mass. 
That's joules per kilogramme kg. 
This is actually just cancel my definition. 
Energy per unit mass. 
How to change. 
The question is how much energy is. 
Water at 023c. 
Naughty greasy on the change. 
Have you got a temperature can have these. 
So here we're gonna use. 
The equals ml. 
The equals ml and. 
The equals l and b e. 
As it changes state. 
The gas here for these three it's four. 
Mc delta theta. 
Steam. 
The definition of the specific latent heat energy. 
It needs to lose 330 kg. 
What's that. 
Team up. 
And you need to know. 
= mc delta theta. 
Minecraft not looking very good. 
I did it yesterday and it wasn't good. 
Stop. 
Right now demo do you need a comfort break. 
Play alarm for school. 
I'm afraid. 
5%. 
Tuesday the thursday here 5:45. 
Paper. 
Homework. 
You got no internet.
